My simplistic implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) as a part of mine 
deliberate practice of TDD and Simple Design in Ruby. Inspired by the [Global Day Of Code Retreat in 2019 with 8th Light](http://geekvasyl.me/2019/11/17/The-Global-Day-of-Coderetreat-with-8th-Light/). 

# How to run?

`$ bin/game_of_life`

# TODO

- [ ] Put Input under the test
- [ ] Add Gemfile to have deterministic dependencies
- [ ] Add guard to automate test execution on every change
- [ ] Improve appearance: title with command bar, better symbols, colours, borders, clear after stop
- [ ] Random seed
- [ ] Add more commands: speed up, speed down, restart, specify another seed file
- [ ] Place the cells on the grid while running
- [ ] Better graphics with JRuby and libGXV, compile to Web Assembly with TeaVM 
- [ ] Infinite grid
